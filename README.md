# Lab9
In-class exercise that built out on the original Lab concept of using a JS array to store grcery item values. 

Changes included adding HTML input forms whose values are captured, stored as a single object, and pushed into the original array utilizing only HTML & vanilla JS functions. 

The 'Add' button not only adds the new object, it also calculates a running total that is displayed by clearing the original div & displaying the entirety of the new array. It creates a running total.

Minimal to no CSS applied.
